Hacks keypads automatically in the GTA5 casino heist.

Works by matching partial fingerprints to those shown during the hack. Simply compares each shown fingerprint to a pool of solution prints, then selects that fingerprint. Due to noise in the background of each fingerprint, comparisons must be approximated.

Only works for 1080P resolution currently.
